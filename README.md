The App is called Timeline simply because I use Google Map's timeline feature a lot and I really like it. 

So I made this Full Stack MERN Application with additional features from ReactMapGL and Mapbox, that allows users to log in and save the places they've visited.

### Development process
For the backend, I'm using MongoDB as database. For this application, there are 2 data models inside the DB: Users and Pins.

Needless to say, every user should have an email and password to login, to creat a new User, the following schema is applied:
```
const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
	{
		username: {
			type: String,
			require: true,
			min: 3,
			max: 20,
			unique: true,
		},
		email: {
			type: String,
			require: true,
			max: 50,
			unique: true,
		},
		password: {
			type: String,
			require: true,
			min: 6,
		},
	},
	{ timestamps: true }
);
```


Once they logged in, they can create their own pin by double clicking anywhere on the map and enter the related infomations.
In this case, they need another data model which is the Pin Schema:

```
const PinSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
	{
		username: {
			type: String,
			require: true,
		},
		title: {
			type: String,
			require: true,
			min: 3,
		},
		desc: {
			type: String,
			require: true,
			min: 3,
		},
		rating: {
			type: Number,
			require: true,
			min: 0,
			max: 5,
		},
		lat: {
			type: Number,
			require: true,
		},
		long: {
			type: Number,
			require: true,
		},
	},
	{ timestamps: true }
);
```
This concludes all the info that a user can enter and save. For the users, there are 3 things for them to be filled: title, description and rating.
Other properties inside this schema like longitute and latitude will be auto generated by ReactmapGL after the double click, which I will talk later.
